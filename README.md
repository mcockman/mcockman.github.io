This is my Github account, it is mostly empty except a repo of some old game my friend and I worked on a few years ago

The repository I created is empty except for this readme file. It will be filled with future projects and work for this class

To clone the repo to my local machine, I downloaded the GitHub desktop app, and logged into my account. I then was offered a few choices including "clone repository"
I chose this option and it localized my repo.
