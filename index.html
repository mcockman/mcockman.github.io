			<h1>My name is Max Cockman</h1>
			<p>
				I've previously taken coding and web development courses while pursuing higher education. I have worked as a Junior Developer for a small web development start up so I am used to using CSS and HTML at an
				experienced level. I look forward to finding out new things and <br> refreshing myself on the topic. I am an avid gamer, and outdoorsman, I love hiking, camping, and fishing.
